# overview
Overview of the LearnDeep-MSOE software project

Learn Deep will use a new fork of some Network Resource Planning (NRP) software that has been used for several other projects around the world. Here's a [short history of the software](https://github.com/django-rea/rea-app/wiki).

You will see two code repositories in this github organization:
* [valuenetwork](https://github.com/LearnDeepMilwaukee/valuenetwork), the NRP models and logic. It also has a user interface, but you will be creating a new and better one.
* [rea-app](https://github.com/django-rea/rea-app), where the new UI will be developed.

This repository is for documentation about the project as a whole.

We encourage you to study the wiki in this repository and all of the documentation links in the other repositories.

This project also has a chat room at https://gitter.im/LearnDeepMilwaukee
